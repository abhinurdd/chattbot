Aim for a regular posting schedule (e.g., 3–4 times a week) to keep the audience engaged.\n\n### Final Thought\nGaurav Chaudhary’s blend of engineering credibility and entrepreneurial spirit makes him a compelling partner for tech‑centric brands. By focusing on high‑value, interactive content and leveraging his cross‑platform reach, you can turn that 0.48 % engagement into a powerful marketing engine. 🚀\n\nLet me know if you’d like help drafting a pitch or brainstorming specific campaign ideas!"
